acme0:

A single OneDGrid with or without membrane for solving the instationary Poisson-Nernst-Planck system

Numerical methods: 
- Standard Galerkin (CG) or Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) local operators
- Fully-coupled solution (via Newton's method) or operator-split (alternating solution of the equations)

Limitations:
When using the membrane, none of the methods is working satisfactory:
- CG method does not allow for a jump of concentrations at the membrane
- For fully-coupled case, usage of a membrane is not possible
- operator-split is unstable even when not using a membrane
