One OneDGrid for the Poisson equation, two OneDGrid's for the Nernst-Planck equation representing the electrolyte subdomains

This program allows for the solution of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck system with inclusing of a membrane. The two
equation (system)s are solved alternately using an operator-split. This, however, limits the possible time step size
to a very small value of 0.1 to 1 nano second.

Numerical methods: 
- Standard Galerkin (CG) local operator
- Operator-split (alternating solution of the equations)

Limitations:
- operator-split is unstable (even when not using a membrane)
