membrane3 short description:

Modeling a thick membrane separating two electrolytes.

Searching for stationary solutions, therefore solving the Poisson Boltzmann equation.

One dimension (using OneDGrid) with constraints (Dirichlet BC).

Convergence is investigated for increasing refinement levels by comparison to analytical solutions.
