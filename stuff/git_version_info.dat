    [bugfix] include memory header to make make_shared available.
    
    According to the standard make_shared is defined in the memory header.
    While we did include the header when testing for make_shared support, we
    forgot to include it in dune/common/shared_ptr.hh. This patch now uses the
    same include statement for memory in dune/common/shared_ptr.h as in the
    m4 test.
    
    This problem does only exist in the release as Christoph already fixed in the
    trunk while stripping our own make_shared implementation.
    
    Kudos to Tatiana and Eike for finding this bug!

    [MCMGMapper][Bugfix] Fix assertion to check whether GeometryType is part of the mapper
    
    The assertion "GlobalGeometryTypeIndex::index(gt) < n" doesn't make
    sense, as n refers to the number of entities in the mapper and not to
    the indexed GeometryTypes.
    
    Fixed by simply reusing the method contains() conveniently provided by
    the layout... ;-)
    
    While I was at it, I also added an equivalent assertion to the plain
    map() method that maps an entity itself.

    [CMake] add version defines to the config.h.cmake
    
    When checking for a certain dune-typetree version using
    DUNE_VERSION_NEWER, the defines where not present and
    the makro did not work.
    
    Kudos to Andreas Nüßing for noticing the problem and providing a patch
    for PDELab.
