# Dune model dune-ax1

This [Dune](http://www.dune-project.org) module contains programs to simulate the intra- and extracellular potential generated by a neuronal membrane. 
It implements the numerical solution of different mathematical models for the electric potential, most importantly the PNP (Poisson-Nernst-Planck) system of electrodiffusion. 
There are additional implementations to solve the VC (volume conductor) model and the [electroneutral model](http://dx.doi.org/10.2140/camcos.2009.4.85) by Yoichiro Mori that allow for comparison.
All this is implemented using a simple, cylinder-symmetrical axon model.

This module was developed as part of my PhD project in the [working group](http://conan.uwr.uni-heidelberg.de) of Prof. Peter Bastian at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computung at Heidelberg University.
Since this code was meant for my own use only, it might be hard to understand for someone not familiar with the background or the Dune framework.
In fact, it is messy, unorganized, poorly commented and it may contain an indefinite amount of bugs.
Some theoretical and technical background can be found in a [2013 Biophysical Journal paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2013.05.041) and in my [PhD thesis](http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/archiv/17128). I strongly recommend reading the latter for some information on the code structure and numerical subtleties.

Please note that I have made this code publicly available for future reference, but I will not be able to continue development or provide support for this specific module.
However, if you have questions regarding the Dune framework in general, there is an active and responsive development community on the [mailing lists](http://www.dune-project.org/mailinglists.html) or the [user wiki](http://users.dune-project.org).

For rudimentary installation instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). An even more rudimentary documentation can be found in [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md), which mainly lists the compile- and run-time configuration options without giving any explanation of the code structure, class design or functionality. For this, please refer to the (largely undocumented) code or [contact me](http://conan.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/people/jpods).
